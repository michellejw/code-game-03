# Code Challenge Scavenger Hunt

A simple, web-based scavenger hunt game that combines coding puzzles with physical exploration. Made for kids ages 7-10 to learn basic (Python-based)coding concepts while having an adventure!

## Overview

This app creates an interactive scavenger hunt where kids solve simple coding puzzles to get clues leading them to physical locations. At each location, they find a code that unlocks the next puzzle, eventually leading to a prize.

## How It Works

1. **Setup (Parent)**: A parent/adult selects puzzle sets and places clues around the house
2. **Play (Kids)**: Kids solve coding puzzles using an interactive Python terminal (powered by Pyodide)
3. **Hunt**: Each solved puzzle reveals the location of the next clue
4. **Win**: The final puzzle leads to a prize!
